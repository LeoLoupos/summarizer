Temperature data for 2016 shows it is likely to have edged ahead of 2015 as the world's warmest year.
Data from Nasa and the UK Met Office shows temperatures were about 0.07 degrees Celsius above the 2015 mark.
Although the Met Office increase was within the margin of error, Nasa says that 2016 was the third year in a row to break the record.
The El Niño weather phenomenon played a role, say scientists, but the main factor was human emissions of CO2.
The latest conclusions won't come as a much of a shock to observers, as the likely outcome was trailed heavily towards the end of last year.
So warm was the early part of 2016 - influenced by a powerful El Niño - that some leading climate scientists were predicting as early as May that a new record was likely.
During an El Niño, a band of unusually warm ocean water develops in parts of the Pacific. The phenomenon affects the climate globally, disrupting weather patterns.
What is climate change?
How global temperature has changed
According to Nasa figures, 2016 is now the warmest year in a record that dates back to 1880.
"2015 has been the warmest year on record up until now, so 2016 has just beaten that and and it's beaten that by about 0.1- 0.12 of a degree Celsius, which doesn't seem like a lot, but in terms of the year to year variations it's actually huge," Dr Gavin Schmidt from Nasa told BBC News.
"This is a very clear record that we're seeing. It is driven mainly by changes in the tropical Pacific where we had an El Niño event that produced a lot of warmth. But we've also seen long term trends in warming mostly due to the increasing greenhouse gases."
Many parts of the world had their warmest recorded year in 2016
Another factor that has affected temperatures in 2016 is the unusual warmth in the Arctic.
The sea-ice covering the Arctic reached its second lowest level (in terms of extent) in September 2016. The sea-ice grows in autumn and winter and shrinks each spring and summer.
While the sea-ice extent last year didn't break the record, the mercury stayed high and the smaller amount of ice now present in the region is at unprecedented levels for the time of year.
A number of meteorological agencies from around the world have released their figures today. They all suggest that warming in 2016 was a record that had an important contribution from El Niño.
The Met Office says it contributed about 0.2C to the annual average for 2016. However, researchers believe that while this is substantial, it is not the whole story.
"We understand the contribution El Niño makes fairly well and we've seen it many times," said Prof Ellie Highwood from the University of Reading.
"But even if you take that contribution away, we would expect 2015 and 2016 to still be the warmest years we've seen, so a majority of it is coming from global warming and the greenhouse effect."
The World Meteorological Organisation (WMO), which pulls together temperature data from a number of sources, agrees that 2016 broke the record by 0.07C.
Not all of the reports on temperature data in 2016 are clear that the warmest-year record has been broken.
Century dominated by records
The Met Office says that 2016 was 0.77 above the long term rate, but with a plus or minus error margin of 0.1C, meaning that last year was at the very least, one of the two warmest years on record.
"The final figures confirm that 2016 was yet another extremely warm year," said Peter Stott from the Met Office.
"The temperature for last year was very close to the year before, temperatures for 2016 exceeding those for 2015 by a small margin."
Regardless of the small margins, when the new data on 2016 is included, 15 of the warmest 16 years on record have now occurred since 2001.
According to Noaa (the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration), the only year from the 20th Century to break into the top 16 is 1998, and which ranks seventh warmest.
This prolonged period of warming was having significant impacts around the world.
The Arctic region exceeded the long term average by up to 6C through most of 2016
"We have also broken sea ice minimum records in the Arctic and Antarctic," said Petteri Taalas from the WMO.
"The Arctic is warming twice as fast as the global average. The persistent loss of sea-ice is driving weather, climate and ocean circulation patterns in other parts of the world. We also have to pay attention to the potential release of methane from melting permafrost," he said.
Of great concern to scientists and politicians is the fact that the newly published temperature data shows the Earth is once again more than one degree warmer than pre-industrial times, and edging closer to the threshold of 1.5C set under the Paris climate pact.
With the Trump administration about to take office in the US, there are concerns that political support for climate action might fade. This would be a big mistake according to scientists.
"Climate change is one of the great challenges of the 21st Century and shows no signs of slowing down," said Prof Mark Maslin, from University College London.
"The decarbonisation of the global economy is the ultimate goal to prevent the worst effects of climate change. The hottest year on record is such a clear warning siren that even President-elect Trump cannot ignore it."
Researchers say that 2017 is unlikely to break the warming record but will be in the top five hottest years.

US President Barack Obama has come under fire from top Republicans for his decision to commute the sentence of Chelsea Manning, who leaked documents to Wikileaks in 2010.
House Speaker Paul Ryan said the move set a "dangerous precedent".
But White House spokesman Josh Earnest said the time already served by Manning was an appropriate punishment.
The 29-year-old transgender US Army private, born Bradley Manning, will be freed on 17 May.
She had been scheduled to be released in 2045.
Manning was sentenced to 35 years in 2013 for her role in leaking diplomatic cables to the anti-secrecy group, one of the largest breaches of classified material in US history.
The commutation reduces Manning's sentence but is not a pardon, which some campaigners had called for.
US Republican Senator John McCain called the commutation a "grave mistake"
Senator John McCain, chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, called it a "grave mistake".
He said in a statement: "It is a sad, yet perhaps fitting commentary on President Obama's failed national security policies that he would commute the sentence of an individual that endangered the lives of American troops, diplomats, and intelligence sources by leaking hundreds of thousands of sensitive government documents to Wikileaks, a virulently anti-American organisation that was a tool of Russia's recent interference in our elections.
"Her prison sentence may end in a few months' time, but her dishonour will last forever," he said.
Mr Ryan said President Obama "now leaves in place a dangerous precedent that those who compromise our national security won't be held accountable for their crimes".
White House press secretary Josh Earnest hit back at Republican criticism, suggesting the party was being hypocritical given President-elect Donald Trump has praised Wikileaks.
The group released hacked Democratic Party emails during the election campaign.
"It is outrageous for them to suggest that right now what Chelsea Manning did is worse than what the man who they endorsed for president did," he told CBS News.
He also told CNN that Mr Obama believed Manning had served an "appropriate punishment", having been jailed for nearly seven years.
Most people convicted of leaking have received sentences of between one and three years, according to the New York Times. The Obama administration has prosecuted more people for leaking government secrets than were charged under all previous presidencies, the paper says.
Manning twice attempted suicide last year at the male military prison where she is being held at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas.
She also went on a hunger strike last year, which she ended after the military agreed to provide her with gender transition treatment.
Mr Obama granted commutation of sentences to 209 individuals and pardons to 64 others, in one of his final acts as president.
Why is the decision so controversial?
Leaked footage among files leaked by Chelsea Manning showed a US helicopter pilot killing civilians and journalists in Baghdad in 2007
Critics argue that Manning's decision to leak a massive trove of documents to Wikileaks - including 250,000 diplomatic cables and more than 450,000 reports from the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan - endangered US troops, intelligence agents and diplomats, in addition to foreigners who had helped them in hotspots abroad.
By uploading the material online, they say that the documents were made available to everyone, including Al-Qaeda. They also caused major embarrassment to the United States.
Chelsea Manning been characterised as a traitor, even though she said she believed the leaked material would "spark a domestic debate".
Why did Obama act to help Manning, but not Edward Snowden?
Edward Snowden, a former National Security Agency (NSA) contractor, leaked documents revealing extensive internet and phone surveillance by US intelligence, sparking a global debate on internet privacy.
Russian authorities said on Wednesday that Mr Snowden had been granted a two-year extension to his temporary asylum in the country.
More than a million people have signed a petition asking for him to also receive some sort of clemency from President Obama.
But the White House has poured water any hopes that he might be next. Mr Earnest said that in comparison to Mr Snowden, Chelsea Manning went "through the military criminal justice process, was exposed to due process, was found guilty, was sentenced for her crimes, and she acknowledged wrongdoing."
Edward Snowden fled the US in 2013, evading charges that could see him imprisoned for up to 30 years
Mr Snowden, Mr Earnest said, "fled into the arms of an adversary and has sought refuge in a country that most recently made a concerted effort to undermine confidence in our democracy."
He also said the NSA leaker had not filed the paperwork required to seek clemency, and, in any case, Mr Snowden's leaks were said to be "far more serious and far more dangerous" than Manning's.
Media captionJournalist Glenn Greenwald: Chelsea Manning and Edward Snowden "acted with extreme amounts of courage"
What do his supporters say to that?
They argue that what he revealed - and the impact it had - has improved American democracy.
"Thanks to Edward Snowden's act of conscience, we have made historic strides in our fight for surveillance reform and improved cyber security," American Civil Liberties Union executive director Anthony Romero has said.
Human Rights Watch says that the Espionage Act is "a First World War-era law that does not distinguish between selling secrets to foreign governments and giving them to journalists working in the public interest".
Pardoning Snowden, they say, would encourage other whistleblowers to step forward without fear.

About 13 million pages of declassified documents from the US Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) have been released online.
The records include UFO sightings and psychic experiments from the Stargate programme, which has long been of interest to conspiracy theorists.
The move came after lengthy efforts from freedom of information advocates and a lawsuit against the CIA.
The full archive is made up of almost 800,000 files.
They had previously only been accessible at the National Archives in Maryland.
The trove includes the papers of Henry Kissinger, who served as secretary of state under presidents Richard Nixon and Gerald Ford, as well as several hundred thousand pages of intelligence analysis and science research and development.
Among the more unusual records are documents from the Stargate Project, which dealt with psychic powers and extrasensory perception.
Those include records of testing on celebrity psychic Uri Geller in 1973, when he was already a well-established performer.
Memos detail how Mr Geller was able to partly replicate pictures drawn in another room with varying - but sometimes precise - accuracy, leading the researchers to write that he "demonstrated his paranormal perceptual ability in a convincing and unambiguous manner".
Other unusual records include a collection of reports on flying saucers, and the recipes for invisible ink.
While much of the information has been technically publicly available since the mid-1990s, it has been very difficult to access.
The records were only available on four physical computers located in the back of a library at the National Archives in Maryland, between 09:00 and 16:30 each day.
A non-profit freedom of information group, MuckRock, sued the CIA to force it to upload the collection, in a process which took more than two years.
At the same time, journalist Mike Best crowd-funded more than $15,000 to visit the archives to print out and then publicly upload the records, one by one, to apply pressure to the CIA.
"By printing out and scanning the documents at CIA expense, I was able to begin making them freely available to the public and to give the agency a financial incentive to simply put the database online," Best wrote in a blog post.
In November, the CIA announced it would publish the material, and the entire declassified CREST archive is now available on the CIA Library website.

Senegalese troops have been seen moving towards the Gambian border in a show of force to pressure President Yahya Jammeh to stand down.
Senegal gave him a midnight GMT deadline to quit and Nigeria has sent an air force contingent to Senegal in support of the possible intervention.
Wednesday was meant to be his last day in office but parliament has granted him three more months in the post.
It effectively stops successor Adama Barrow being sworn in on Thursday.
His shock victory in the 1 December election plunged The Gambia into crisis. Mr Barrow is currently in Senegal.
West African countries are seeking UN backing to intervene militarily to eject Mr Jammeh, who has ruled The Gambia since taking power in a bloodless coup in 1994.
Meanwhile, thousands of UK and Dutch tourists are being evacuated from the tiny West African state, which is popular with European holidaymakers because of its beaches.
Why is Senegal taking the lead?
Ecowas, the Economic Community of West African States, has mandated Senegal, which almost surrounds The Gambia, to spearhead military intervention, but only as a last resort and with the backing of the UN Security Council.
"We are ready and are awaiting the deadline at midnight," Col Abdou Ndiaye, a spokesman for the Senegalese military, was quoted as saying by Reuters news agency.
"If no political solution is found, we will step in."
The Gambia's entire armed forces are made up of only about 2,500 troops, making it difficult to see how they can defeat a regional force if it moves in, says BBC Africa Monitoring security correspondent Tomi Oladipo.
Nigeria says it sent fighters and other aircraft, along with 200 personnel, to Senegal on Wednesday morning.
Nigerian navy vessels are also on standby and a warship that sailed from Lagos on Tuesday will have the task of evacuating Nigerian citizens while putting on a show of force.
Ground troops are also being provided by Ghana.
Ecowas has always maintained that it will only deploy troops as a last resort, triggered by the overt use of violence by Gambian security forces against civilians.
A military operation by West African forces would first have to be approved by the UN Security Council.
Could there be a refugee crisis?
At least 26,000 Gambians, mostly women and children, had crossed into Senegal by Monday evening amid fears that violence could erupt, the UN refugee agency said, citing Senegalese government figures.
"The flow has increased sharply since then," regional spokeswoman Helene Caux was quoted by Reuters as saying.
Travel firm Thomas Cook said it would fly back to the UK, over the next 48 hours, 985 customers from package holidays after the Foreign Office advised "against all but essential travel to The Gambia due to ongoing political uncertainty and potential military intervention following the presidential elections".
About 1,600 Dutch citizens are also being flown home after similar advice from their government.
Tourism has become the fastest-growing sector of The Gambia's economy, and the country, which has a population of about two million, was marketed to holidaymakers as "the smiling coast of West Africa".
But many of its citizens are poor and complain of political repression. Some, including the goalkeeper of the national women's football team, have drowned in the Mediterranean trying to reach Europe in the hope of a better life.
Why is Mr Jammeh refusing to leave office?
Mr Jammeh has declared a 90-day state of emergency, telling security forces to "maintain absolute peace, law and order".
He says there were irregularities in the election process, including the turning away of some of his supporters from polling stations, and errors made by the electoral commission.
The commission accepted that some of the results it initially published contained errors but said Mr Barrow had still won.
Mr Jammeh has said he will stay in office until new elections are held.
Retaining power would also ensure he was not prosecuted in The Gambia for alleged abuses committed during his rule.
The US state department urged Mr Jammeh to peacefully transfer power to Mr Barrow on Thursday.
"Doing so would allow him to leave office with his head held high and to protect The Gambian people from potential chaos," spokesman John Kirby said.
