We are living in a giant hologram, and everything we see around us is merely a projection of a two-dimensional surface.
This is the bizarre theory put forward in 1997 by physicist Juan Maldacena, who was able to prove its existence in equations that only partially explain our universe.
Now researchers in Austria have, for the first time, been able to show how this strange holographic principle can also work in a more realistic model of our cosmos.
The holographic principle suggests that, like the security chip on your credit card, there is a two-dimensional surface that we can't see.
This surface contains all the information needed to describe a three-dimensional object - which in this case is our universe.
In essence, the principle claims that data containing a description of 3D object – such as the device you're reading this on - could be hidden in a region of this flattened, 'real' version of the universe.
Maldacena came to this conclusion when he discovered that mathematical descriptions of the universe actually require one fewer dimension than it seems.
But up until now, this principle has only been studied in something known as 'curved anti-de-sitter spaces' – or exotic spaces with negative curvature.
Scientists came up with these spaces as way to combine describing gravity in a three-dimensional setting while predicting quantum particles in two spatial dimensions.
Anti-de-sitter spaces are negatively curved, and any object thrown away on a straight line will eventually return.
The problem is they are very different from the spaces in our own universe. 
Our universe is largely flat, and on astronomic distances, it has positive curvature.
The latest study by scientists at the Technology University of Vienna now suggests that the holographic principle holds in a flat space-time.
'Juan Maldacena proposed the idea that there is a correspondence between gravitational theories in curved anti-de-sitter spaces on the one hand and quantum field theories in spaces with one fewer dimension on the other', says Daniel Grumiller from the Technology University of Vienna.
To test the theory, scientists spent three years creating gravitational equations that do not require exotic spaces and, instead, live in a flat space.
'If quantum gravity in a flat space allows for a holographic description by a standard quantum theory, then there must by physical quantities, which can be calculated in both theories – and the results must agree', says Grumiller.
They said one key feature of quantum mechanics –quantum entanglement – had to appear in the more realistic model of our universe.
When quantum particles are entangled, they cannot be described individually. 
They form a single quantum object, even if they are located far apart.
There is a measure for the amount of entanglement in a quantum system, called 'entropy of entanglement'.
The team showed that this entanglement takes the same value in both a flat quantum gravity model and in a low dimension quantum field theory.
'This calculation affirms our assumption that the holographic principle can also be realised in flat spaces,' said Max Riegler at the Technology University of Vienna.
'It is evidence for the validity of this correspondence in our universe', says Max Riegler (TU Wien).
'The fact that we can even talk about quantum information and entropy of entanglement in a theory of gravity is astounding in itself, and would hardly have been imaginable only a few years back,' added Grumiller.
'That we are now able to use this as a tool to test the validity of the holographic principle, and that this test works out, is quite remarkable.'

In the weeks since taking office, President Trump has derided court decisions as “ridiculous” and “disgraceful,” called the legitimacy of federal judges into question and encouraged people to blame the courts in the event of another terrorist attack.
But Mr. Trump could soon find himself responsible for appointing a greater share of federal court judges than any first-term president in 40 years, in large part because of a growing number of older judges and a stack of vacancies on the federal courts.
There are 870 Article III federal court judgeships, the vast majority on district courts or appeals courts like the one that recently upheld a halt on Mr. Trump’s immigration ban. These judges are appointed by the president and serve a lifetime term. (A few federal judges are appointed for limited terms.)
After Jimmy Carter took office, Congress established 152 new federal judgeships, expanding the federal judiciary by nearly 30 percent and allowing Mr. Carter to stack the federal courts despite a presidency that lasted only one term.
Mr. Trump, through a combination of demography and a growing number of vacancies, stands to enjoy a similar windfall. Democrats have long accused Republican Senate leaders of obstruction in not allowing many of the previous administration’s judicial nominees to come to a vote. The most prominent example was the refusal to vote on Judge Merrick Garland’s nomination to the Supreme Court, but the tactic extended to Mr. Obama’s lower court nominees as well.
“Right off the bat, Republicans refused to approve anyone,” said Nan Aron, president of the liberal group Alliance for Justice. “So you know how important this is to the Republican Party.” Currently, 112 of the 870 authorized judgeships with lifetime appointments remain vacant — 33 have been vacant for more than two years.
John Malcolm, the director of the conservative Heritage Foundation’s Center for Legal and Judicial Studies, agreed with Ms. Aron’s characterization. “Mr. Trump has been given quite the opportunity,” Mr. Malcolm said, noting that there were about twice the number of vacancies on the federal bench as there were when Mr. Obama took office — “roughly an eighth of the judiciary.”
It’s not just vacancies. The federal bench has many judges who are older than 70. Federal judges are appointed for life, but at a certain combination of years served and age, they become eligible to accept “senior status,” a form of semi-retirement. If a judge enters senior status, that creates an open seat. Though it is highly unlikely, if all the federal judges who are eligible take senior status during Mr. Trump’s first term, he could appoint half of the federal bench.

The long-sought quantum computer, a machine potentially far ahead of today’s best supercomputers, is almost as hard to define as it is to build. For at least a few particular uses, however, the unusual computer made by D-Wave Systems now seems to be very fast indeed.
Next week a professor at Amherst College will present her findings about the performance of the D-Wave machine, which its makers say makes use of such unusual properties of quantum physics as a particle’s ability to move in one direction and its opposite at the same time.
The professor, Catherine C. McGeoch, who is the Beitzel professor in technology and society at Amherst, gave the machine a so-called optimization problem and compared the results with those generated by  popular software from I.B.M. running on a high-performance machine.
The D-Wave machine, she said, was 3,600 times as fast as the  conventional system.
“There is no sense in which this is the definitive statement about quantum computing,” Ms. McGeoch said. “I’m more interested in how well it works, not whether or not it is quantum.”
That question matters a great deal to some others in the field. While quantum properties are among the most tested and proven domains of physics, the concepts behind them — for example, suggestions that we live in one of many universes, or that objects not in direct contact can affect each other — make such properties hard to accept.
Harnessing them for the sake of computation, suggested as a possibility more than two decades ago, has proved difficult.
The optimization problem is typically something like how a traveling salesman would plan a complicated trip most effectively. Ms. McGeoch tested three problems involving optimization. In two of them, the D-Wave computer was slightly faster. In the third, it was markedly faster.
D-Wave, which was the subject of an article in The New York Times in March, has been criticized for making claims about its quantum capabilities that cannot be supported.
Over time, however, D-Wave’s performance has improved, and the skeptics have toned down their criticism. Nonetheless, D-Wave is sensitive about the issue and, even after selling a working machine to Lockheed Martin, eager to rebut the criticism.
Ms. McGeoch, who has spent more than 25 years testing computer speeds, performed the experiments while on sabbatical and was retained by D-Wave to run the tests.
D-Wave solves optimization problems by setting them in the context of energy consumption: the lowest power needed to achieve a stated outcome, which it says is quickly achieved through a quantum process, is the answer. D-Wave thinks that many problems in computing might be restated as optimization problems and that its machine could be coupled with cloud computing systems for particularly hard problems.
Ms. McGeoch said D-Wave’s chips had performed well and might have better outcomes in the future, as its machines become more powerful, and more complex optimization problems are set.
“There could be a tipping point,” she said. “If the problems get big enough, conventional systems break down. In theory, you could solve a large number of optimization problems. People don’t know how to do that conventionally without losing a lot of efficiency.”
